# JavaScript Homework

My repository is posted here: (https://github.com/kescobar10/hw_javascript_escobar_kenia).

## Resources

I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

## Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and the syllabus.

## Comments

I'm not feeling very confident about JavaScript so far. I've watched all the videos at least twice, read the resources and additional links, but everything still feels unclear. I think a live class will help.
